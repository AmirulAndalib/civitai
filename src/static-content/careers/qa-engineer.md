**Job Title:** QA Engineer (Junior Developer / Bug Tester)
**Location:** Fully Remote
**Compensation:** $65,000–$75,000 USD annually
**Employment Type:** Full-time
**Benefits:** Employer-paid healthcare coverage (U.S. only)

### **Overview**
We are seeking an entry-level QA Engineer to join our development team. This role is ideal for a junior developer looking to gain real-world experience in software testing, debugging, and collaborative development workflows. You’ll be responsible for testing all code deployments to our staging environment, identifying issues, logging them clearly, and coordinating with developers to ensure stable and high-quality releases.

You'll work closely with both engineers and support teams, fixing smaller issues yourself, implementing basic test automation, and learning modern development and QA practices.

### **Key Responsibilities**
* Test all staging deployments for functionality, performance, and regressions before production release.
* Write clear and reproducible bug reports in the ticketing system, including steps to replicate and environment details.
* Verify fixes and confirm that reported issues are fully resolved.
* Collaborate with developers to ensure bug reports are well-documented and prioritized.
* Conduct exploratory testing on new features and site functionality.
* Fix low-complexity bugs and issues independently, including front-end adjustments, configuration changes, and minor back-end fixes.
* Implement and maintain basic automated tests for critical user flows and regression scenarios.
* Maintain organized test plans and documentation for recurring features.
* Participate in sprint planning and release meetings to anticipate testing needs.
* Gradually expand test automation coverage for repetitive testing scenarios.

### **Requirements**
* 1–2 years of experience in software development or QA (internships count).
* Basic understanding of version control systems (Git).
* Familiarity with issue tracking tools such as Jira, Linear, or ClickUp.
* Strong attention to detail and ability to reproduce and document issues accurately.
* Foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a backend language).
* Eagerness to learn and grow in a fast-paced development environment.
* Excellent communication and organizational skills.

### **Nice to Have**
* Experience with automated testing tools (e.g., Playwright, Cypress, Jest).
* Familiarity with API testing (Postman or similar).
* Previous experience testing web applications or SaaS platforms.
* Experience with continuous integration/deployment pipelines.

### **Why Join**
You'll gain hands-on experience across the full software development lifecycle, including testing, debugging, fixing issues, implementing automation, and deployment. This position is perfect for someone starting their dev career who wants to build strong technical depth through both manual testing and automation while making a real impact on live production systems. You'll have opportunities to directly improve code quality, fix issues yourself, and build automated safeguards against future regressions.
