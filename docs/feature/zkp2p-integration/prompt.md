I'm wanting to integrate this ZKP2P iframe as outlined in the docs\feature\zkp2p-integration\zkp2p-headless-readme.md file. And I want to make it so that each of the payment methods that are available in ZKP2P appear as payment methods for purchasing Buzz. And ideally what happens when you click any of those payment methods, it opens up a page on civitai.com, perhaps civitai.com slash, you know, ZKP2P. or something like that, and has the iframe embedded there. And the iframe has the URL set to the correct parameters based on the amount of dollars that they were planning on spending or the amount of buzz that they were planning on purchasing. And then it presents them that on-ramp there in the iframe. And then the iframe process goes through. Potentially, we even hook to the events that are inside of the iframe. I think that that's documented in the readme. and then this iframe kind of walks them through the process and even tells them, you know, hey, you got buzz. Then, ideally, once we get to that final step, it has a go home button, and I don't know, maybe we need to change that on the other end to actually make it so that that gets sent up the pipe so that it can send them back, or we can listen to some other signal. If you have questions about that, feel free to leave a comment in here and ask for details and I'll add them. So let's go ahead and start by reviewing the document there, and then if you could create an implementation plan inside of this docs\feature\zkp2p-integration folder, that would be great.
